I created this very simple app in Angular 6 to explore Angular 6 framework :), during exploring the Angular 6 i learn and practice following things
1. How to Create Service to recive Ajax call with promises.
2.Model Classes for data
3.Modules and classes concepts in Angular 6
4.Angular cli which i personally love ;)
5.Directives and two way data binding. specially The Banana In a Box {(LOL)} 
6. Data passing Parent to child and vice versa.
7. Routing with parameters
8. TypeScript which is good for Enterprise App and have better tools
